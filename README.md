# Streaming Data Management and Time Series Forecasting

Forecasting of historical data using R (KFAS and forecast libraries) and Python (Darts library). I employed and compared alternative techniques:
- ARIMA
- Unobserved Components Model (UCM)
- Deep Learning (RNNs)

In the competition within the class, I obtained the second best score in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
